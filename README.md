# Pacman Multiagents Project

## Overview
This project explores various search algorithms and multi-agent adversarial strategies using the classic arcade game Pacman. The agents implemented in this project utilize search strategies to navigate the Pacman world, avoid ghosts, and consume all the pellets.

## Key Features
- **Search Algorithms**: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Uniform-Cost Search (UCS), and A* Search.
- **Corners Problem**: Implementations that find paths through all four corners of a maze.
- **Food Search**: A search problem where Pacman must eat all the dots in as few steps as possible.
- **Adversarial Search**: Includes Reflex Agent, Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Expectimax algorithms to handle ghost behaviors.
- **Evaluation Functions**: Advanced functions to evaluate and enhance the performance of Pacman in various game scenarios.
